## How To Use

### 1. k6 should be installed

### 2. Clone the project. Preferrably open it with VS Code

The test command should be run in the same path. Also the report will generate at the same path.

### 3. Config your Test Scenario in the `test-scenarios.js` file

You can put load, stress, spike and soak tests scenario here and use them easily in the main script. 

> ðŸ’¡ If you want a phase to be calculated for real concurrent users capacity of your application (which is usually the peak phase), you can flag it with `usersCapacityCalcRef: true` as below:

```js
export let scenario_15min = [
  { duration: "30s", target: 100 }, // warm-up (below normal load)
  { duration: "20s", target: 500 }, // normal load
  { duration: "3m", target: 1300 }, // high load (below the breaking point)
  { duration: "3m", target: 2000 }, // increase toward app limit
  { duration: "10m", target: 2000, usersCapacityCalcRef: true }, // Stress load (around the breaking point)
  { duration: "60s", target: 0 }, // scale down (recovery stage)
];
```

### 4. Config your HTTP Request in the `test-http-requests.js` file

Configur your Get or Post HTTP requests as objects with proper URL, body and headers if needed so repetitive use of those requests will be easy.

```js
const url1 = "https://httpbin.test.k6.io/get";
const url2 = "https://test.k6.io";
const url3 = "https://httpbin.test.k6.io/post";

export const testEndpoint1 = {
  method: "GET",
  url: url1,
};

export const testEndpoint2 = {
  method: "GET",
  url: url2,
};

export const testEndpoint3 = {
  method: "GET",
  url: url3,
};
```

### 5. Modify main script `test.js` only in SETTINGS block section.

```js
import http from "k6/http";
import { check, sleep } from "k6";
import { Counter } from "k6/metrics";
import { htmlReport } from "./HtmlReporter.js";
import { usersCapacityCalPhases, logUsersCapacityPhases } from "./helper.js";
import * as httpRequests from "./test-http-requests.js";
import * as scenarios from "./test-scenarios.js";

// ####################### TEST SETTINGS ###########################

// ## HTTP request to call. HTTP requests can be found and modified in `./test-http-requests.js` file
const targetHttpEndpoint = httpRequests.testEndpoint;
// ## Scenario (staging) for the test. Scenarios can be found and modified in `./test-scenarios.js` file
let targetScenario = scenarios.scenario_1min;
// ## Max acceptable response time - otherwise the check fails for the request
const responseTimeThreshold = 5;
// ## Real users average requests per minutes in your app
const realUsersRPM = 3;
// ## Set to true if you want to show the CLI result as well
const showCliResult = false;
// ## The generated HTML report page title. Things you want to remember in case of saving it and try to see it later
const htmlReportTitle = "Server x - 16 Replicas - Internal Net - 2000 VUs";

// #################### END OF TEST SETTINGS ########################

const usersCapacityPhases = usersCapacityCalPhases(targetScenario);

// rest of script
```

### 6. Run the test: `k6 run test.js`

The result will be saved in the same folder. Can be saved anywhere for future reference as it's simple html page.

### 7. Next Runs

You defined all your possible scenarios in `test-scenarios.js` file and all HTTP requests in the `test-http-requests.js` file. So for following tests, only need to modify the *TEST SETTINGS* section and run the test.

## What Am I Trying to Achieve Here?

### 1. Enhanced k6 HTML Reporter

By integrating the k6 HTML-reporter, you can replace the plain text CLI results with a more visually appealing results also enabling to easily keep historical records of test results. Although not the ultimate visualization tool for k6, it significantly improves readability and tracking over the CLI summary. Advanced visualizations can be achieved by exporting data to InfluxDB and visualizing with Grafana, but for many businesses, the HTML report suffices.

> ðŸ’¡ No changes or additional setup are required for this HTML report to work. Simply use the `performance-test.js` script, and it will generate `results.html` in the same directory. This file can then be easily saved for historical records.

### 2. Enhanced Error Tracking with Custom Metrics

To better understand `status_code=0` errors, especially during stress and spike tests, custom metrics have been added. These metrics utilize the `error_code` parameter in k6, providing more insight into the errors encountered.

### 3. Improved Test Result Analysis

The top five boxes in the test results are crucial for analysis:

- **Total Requests**: Total number of requests sent to the server.
- **Failed Requests**: Number of failed HTTP requests, including timeouts, connection errors, and non-2xx status codes.
- **OK Responses**: Requests with a 200 status code response. This is a basic success metric.
- **Failed Checks**: Invalidated HTTP responses by some checks, can be not a success code and/or long response time, etc.
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of requests resulting in 2xx status codes.

### 4. Estimating Real-World User Capacity

Converting Virtual Users (VUs) to real-world users involves several steps:

1. **Ensure the test passes without breaching any thresholds.** This means knowing your application's limits.
    ```js
    stages: testScenario,

      thresholds: {
        http_req_duration: [`p(95)<${maxAcceptableResponseTime * 1000}`],
      },
    ```
    > ðŸ’¡ This threshold means 95% of requests must complete within the acceptable response time.

2. **Specify the RPM (requests per minute) of real-world users.** For example, if a user makes 10 requests in 5 minutes, that's 2 RPM.
    <img src="https://github.com/farshaddavoudi/k6-performance-testing/blob/main/screenshots/real-user-rpm.png" alt="Real User RPM">

3. **Run the test in a real scenario.** Tests should be long enough (at least 40 minutes) to gather meaningful data.
    > ðŸ’¡ Focus on the peak phase to determine the maximum concurrent users the application can handle.

### 5. Implementing a Graceful Rate Limit

Setting a rate limit ensures that the system remains stable under load, preventing overwhelming the server and drastically increasing response times. This involves limiting both individual user calls and total concurrent users.

## Additional Notes

- Tests should run for more than 30 minutes while monitoring server CPU and RAM usage.
- k6 integrates with Grafana for advanced visualizations.
- Testing in a Kubernetes cluster can help determine the necessary resources to handle expected traffic.
- One approach to see the limits in K8s cluster is we can test with a tiny container with limited resources and then determine how much instances do we need to support the traffic load that we need.
- Monitor your testing environment (e.g., your server's CPU, RAM, and network status) to avoid bottlenecks.
- Custom metrics are displayed only if they have non-zero values.

## Special Thanks

This project is ported from the [k6-reporter](https://github.com/benc-uk/k6-reporter) project with customizations and optimizations for easier and more effective k6 usage. Thanks to Ben Coleman (@benc-uk) and all contributors.
